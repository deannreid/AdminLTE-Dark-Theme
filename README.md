# AdminLTE Dark Theme
 AdminLTE Dark theme for Pi-Hole WI v5.3.1
 
 The design idea was originally from @DoctorMidnight - https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/dark-admin-theme/647 I have just re-created it to work on the latest AdminLTE version
 
I have also added more information to the tab menu - If you don't want this - then don't copy the header.php file
